# Build Progress: 009-upon-app-reload-go-to-the-last-open-project

## Status: COMPLETED

## Completed Chunks

### chunk-1-1 - Update project-store.ts to persist selectedProject
- **Status**: Completed
- **Commit**: b1f45dc
- **Changes**:
  - Added `LAST_SELECTED_PROJECT_KEY` constant for localStorage key
  - Updated `selectProject` action to persist projectId to localStorage
  - Updated `removeProject` action to clear localStorage when removing selected project
  - Updated `loadProjects` function to restore last selected project from localStorage
  - Added fallback to first project if persisted project no longer exists

## Implementation Summary

The feature adds localStorage persistence for the selected project in the Electron app:

1. **On project selection**: The `selectedProjectId` is saved to localStorage
2. **On project deselection**: The localStorage entry is removed
3. **On project removal**: If the removed project was selected, localStorage is cleared
4. **On app reload**: The `loadProjects()` function checks localStorage for a previously selected project and restores it if it still exists

## Verification

Manual verification required:
1. Open app, select a project
2. Reload the app (Cmd+R or close and reopen)
3. Verify the same project is still selected
