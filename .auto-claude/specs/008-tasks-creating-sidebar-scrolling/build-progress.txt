# Build Progress: Fix Task Card Horizontal Scrolling

## Chunk 1-1: Add overflow-hidden and break-words to TaskCard
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Date:** 2025-12-12

### Changes Made
Modified `auto-claude-ui/src/renderer/components/TaskCard.tsx`:

1. **CardContent** (line 251): Added `min-w-0` to allow children to shrink below their content size
2. **Header flex container** (line 253): Added `min-w-0` to enable proper text truncation in flex context
3. **Title h3** (line 257): Added `min-w-0` to work with existing `break-words overflow-hidden`
4. **Description p** (line 306): Added `min-w-0` for consistent overflow handling
5. **Progress section container** (line 343): Added `min-w-0`
6. **Progress flex container** (line 344): Added `min-w-0 gap-2` for proper spacing
7. **Progress message span** (line 345): Added `truncate min-w-0 flex-1` to handle long execution messages
8. **Percentage span** (line 353): Added `shrink-0` to prevent compression
9. **Footer container** (line 402): Added `min-w-0 gap-2`
10. **Footer time container** (line 403): Added `min-w-0 shrink-0`

### Technical Details
The key fix is adding `min-w-0` to flex children. In flexbox, the default `min-width: auto` prevents items from shrinking below their content size. By setting `min-w-0` (min-width: 0), we allow text containers to shrink and enable `break-words`, `truncate`, and `overflow-hidden` to work correctly.

### Verification
Manual testing required:
1. Create a task with a very long description without spaces (e.g., 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')
2. Verify the Kanban board does not scroll horizontally
3. Verify the text is properly truncated or wrapped within the card
